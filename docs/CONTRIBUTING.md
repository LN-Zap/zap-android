#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines) to know more about our coding conventions and practices.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Please join us on [slack][slack] and check [open issues][issues] to see what contributions are needed before tackling a task to avoid duplicate work.
