## How to translate:

1. Go to [this crowdin project][crowdin]
2. Selecct your language
3. Select "app texts"
4. If you don't have a crowdin account, you have to create one now.
5. Translate the missing strings.
6. Celebrate yourself for supporting a free open source project! This step is MANDATORY!


## When will my translation be visible in the app?

Your translation will only be visible in the Zap after an app update. There is no fixed schedule when the Zap receives an update.
So this might take a few days or a few weeks.
