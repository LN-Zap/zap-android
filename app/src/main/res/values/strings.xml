<!-- //////////////// Notice for translators ////////////////////

    First of all, thanks for taking the time to translate this wallet!


    Here are a few tips to help you while translating:

    Parameters:
    Some strings have parameters, which allows them to show different content.
    Parameters look like this:   %1$s  ,  %2$d  ,  ...
    Above every string with a parameter there is an explanation, what this parameter can be.
    With this information you should be able to move the parameter to the correct place in your
    translated string.


    New line:
    \n is used to make a new line.
    Avoid putting a space before and after \n as this will lead to a space at the end and the
    beginning of a line.
    Correct example:  This is my first line.\nAnd this is my second.


    Special Characters:
    Escape every '  or  " you want to have in your text with a backslash.
    Correct example:  I want to emphasize \"this\" and \'this\' word.

    Escape every % with %
    Correct example:   5 is 10%% of 50

    &  =  &amp;
    <  =  &lt;
    >  =  &gt;
